  <h1>PROBABLITY DISTRIBUTION</h1>
    <p>Probability distribution refers to the mathematical function that describes the likelihood of obtaining various outcomes in an experiment or random process. It provides a systematic way to model uncertainty and randomness in various fields, including statistics, mathematics, physics, engineering, economics, and more.</p>
      <ul>
      <h2><li>Introduction</li></h2>
      <p>Probability distribution is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory, describing the likelihood of different outcomes of a random experiment or process. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding uncertainty and randomness in various real-world scenarios. Here's an introduction to probability distributions</p>
      <h2><li>Random Variables</li></h2>
      <p>random variable is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon. It can represent quantities such as the result of a dice roll, the temperature on a given day, or the number of customers in a queue.Random variables can be classified as discrete or continuous based on whether they can take on distinct values or any value within a range, respectively.</p>
        <h2><li>Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)</li></h2>
      <p>For discrete random variables, the probability mass function (PMF) provides the probability of each possible value of the variable.For continuous random variables, the probability density function (PDF) specifies the relative likelihood of the variable taking on different values within a range. The probability of the variable falling within a specific interval is given by the area under the PDF curve over that interval.</p>
        <h2><li>Types of Probability Distributions</li></h2>
      <p>Discrete Distributions: Probability distributions where the random variable can take on a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Examples include the Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, and Geometric distributions.Continuous Distributions: Probability distributions where the random variable can take on any value within a specified range. Examples include the Normal (Gaussian), Exponential, Uniform, and Gamma distributions. Each distribution has its own unique characteristics, such as shape, central tendency, and spread, which are described by parameters like mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.</p>
      <h2><li>Discrete Probability Distribution</li></h2>
      <p>Discrete distributions deal with random variables that can take on a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values.
        Examples of discrete probability distributions include:
        Bernoulli Distribution: Models the outcome of a single experiment with two possible outcomes (success or failure).
        Binomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.
        Poisson Distribution: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.Geometric Distribution: Represents the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Hypergeometric Distribution: Describes the probability of drawing a specific number of successes from a finite population without replacement.</p>
      <h2><li>Continuous Probability Distribution</li></h2>
      <p>Continuous distributions deal with random variables that can take on any value within a given range.Examples of continuous probability distributions include:Uniform Distribution: All values within a specified interval are equally likely.Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: One of the most widely used distributions, characterized by a bell-shaped curve. Many natural phenomena follow this distribution.Exponential Distribution: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process, such as the time between arrivals of customers at a service point.Gamma Distribution: Generalizes the exponential distribution and is used to model waiting times, lifetimes, and other continuous positive variables.Beta Distribution: Flexible distribution defined on the interval [0, 1], often used in Bayesian statistics and modeling proportions.</p>
      <h2><li>Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)</li></h2>
      <p>The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable gives the probability that the variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specified value. For both discrete and continuous distributions, the CDF is defined as the integral or sum of the corresponding PDF or PMF up to a given point.DefinitionFor a random variable, the CDF, denoted by �(�(x), is defined as:�(���≤�)F(x)=P(X≤n other words, �(�F(x) gives the probability that the ranm variable �X takes on a value less than or equal to �Properti�F(x) is non-decreasing function:�x increas�F(x) does not decre�F(x) is right-continuous: The CDF has no jumps, meaning t�F(x) approaches its lim from the right�x approaches any given po�F(x) ranges from 0 to 1: Sce probabilities lie between 0 and 1, the CDF also takes values inthisrange.�x approaches negative infini�F(x) approaches 0, anx approaches positive infini�)F(x) approaches 1.Relationship with PDF/PMFFor continuous random variables, the �F(x) can be obtained by integrating the Probability Density Function (P�f(x) from negative infinity�)∫��F(x)=∫ −∞xf(t)For discrete random variables, the �F(x) can be obtained by summing the Probability Mass Function (P�(x) from negative infinity�)�)F(x)=∑ t≤xp(t)Inverse of CDFhe inverse function of the CDF, denoted�−�)F  (p), es the value�x for wh��F(x)=p.This is useful in probability theory for finding quantiles or percentiles of a distribution. </p>
      <h2><li>Applications</li></h2>
      <p>Probability distributions are used extensively in statistics, data analysis, machine learning, finance, engineering, and various other fields.They provide tools for modeling and analyzing random phenomena, making predictions, estimating parameters from data, simulating scenarios, and making decisions under uncertainty. Understanding probability distributions and their properties is essential for statistical inference, hypothesis testing, risk assessment, and decision-making in diverse domains. It forms the basis for much of modern statistical theory and practice.The CDF is used to describe and summarize the behavior of random variables.It is crucial in hypothesis testing, as it helps in calculating probabilities associated with test statistics.It is used to compute various statistics such as the mean, median, variance, and moments of a distribution.Overall, the Cumulative Distribution Function is a fundamental tool in probability theory and statistics, providing a concise summary of the distribution of a random variable and enabling various statistical analyses and inference procedures.</p>

  <h1>LINEAR PROGRAMMING</h1>
  <p>
    Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model subject to certain linear constraints. It is widely used in various fields, including operations research, economics, engineering, finance, and management, to solve optimization problems involving linear relationships.Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical technique used to optimize (maximize or minimize) a linear objective function subject to a set of linear equality and/or inequality constraints. It is one of the most widely used optimization techniques in various fields due to its simplicity and effectiveness.</p>
  <ul>
    <h2><li>General linear programming </li></h2>
    <p>The jective function is a linear expression representing the quantity to be optimized (maximized or minimized). It is typically written in the form:Maximiz���2+…�Maximizec 1x 1+c 2x 2+…+c nx  nMinimiz��1� � 2+…� Minimizec 1 x 1+c 2x 2+…+c nx nHere,�1�2,…  x 1,x 2,…,x nare decision variables, and�1�2,…�c 1,c 2,…,c nare coefficients representing the contribution of each variable to the objective function.</p>
    <h2><li>Constraints</li></h2>
    <p>Constraints are linear relationships that strict the values of decision variables. They are represented as linear inequalities or equations.onstraints are typically written in the form�11�2+…���1a 11x 1+a 12x 2    +…+a1nx n≤b 12�12�2+…���2a 21 x 1+a 22 x  2+…+an 2nx n≤b 2  ⋮��1 ��2+ …��a m1x 1+a m2x 2+…+a  mnx n≤b mHere,�a ijare coefficients,� b iare constants, and� m is the number of constraints. </p>
    <h2><li>Feasible Region</li></h2>
    <p>The feasible region is the set of all feasible solutions that satisfy all constraints. It is typically represented geometrically as the intersection of half-spaces defined by the constraints.The feasible region in linear programming refers to the set of all feasible solutions that satisfy all the constraints of the optimization problem. In other words, it is the region of the decision variable space where all the constraints are simultaneously satisfiedMathematically, the feasible region is defined by the intersection of all the constraint inequalities and equalities.

In three-dimensional spa�1 1�2 2�3x 3), the feasible region is a polyhedron. In higher dimensions, it becomes a higher-dimensional polytope.</p>
    <h2><li>Canonical form and the standard form</li></h2>
    <p>In linear programming, problems are often expressed in different forms to facilitate the application of optimization algorithms. Two common forms are the canonical form and the standard form. Let's define both:Canonical Form: In the canonical form, the objective function is to minimize a linear combination of decision variables subject to linear inequality constraints.The constraints are typically written in the form of inequalities,andthedecisionvariablesarenon-negative.Thanonical form of a linear programming problem is as follows:Mini��+�Minimizec 1x 1+c 2x 2+…+c nx nSubject��+�1a 11x 1+a12x 2+…+a 1nx ≤b ��+�2a 21x 1+a 22x 2+…+a2nx n≤b  ��+a m1x 1+a 2x 2 +…+amn x ≤b ��,�≥0x 1 ,x 2,…,x n≥0Standard Form:In the standard form, the objective function is to maximize or minimize a linear combination of decision variables subject to linear equality and non-negativity constraints.The constraints are written as equalities, and the decision variables are non-negative.Thtandard form of a linear programming problem is as follows:Maxi��+�Maximizec1x 1+c 2x 2+…+c nx nSubject�+�1a 11x 1+a 12x 2+…+a 1nx =b ��+�2a 21x 1+a 22x 2+…+a 2n x  =b ��+�a m1x 1 +am2x 2+…+a mnx =b ��,�≥0x 1,x 2,…,x n≥0 </p>
    <h2><li>Types of solutions</li></h2>
    <p> Feasible Solu feasible solution is a set of values for the decision variables that satisfies all the constraints of the LP problem. In other words, a feasible solution lies within the feasible region defined by the constraints.Feasible solutions are essential because they represent valid solutions to the problem, even if they may not be optimal.Optimal Solution:An optimal solution is a feasible solution that either maximizes or minimizes the objective function, depending on the optimization goal.For a maximization problem, the optimal solution corresponds to the highest achievable objective function value among all feasible solutions. For a minimization problem, the optimal solution corresponds to the lowest achievable objective function value among all feasible solutions.An LP problem may have one or more optimal solutions, especially if the objective function is unbounded or if there are multiple solutions that achieve the same optimal value.Unbounded Solu problem has an unbounded solution if the objective function can be made arbitrarily large (in the case of maximization) or arbitrarily small (in the case of minimization) while still satisfying all the constraints.This situation typically occurs when the feasible region is unbounded or when there are no feasible solutions.Infeasible Solution:An LP problem is said to be infeasible if there are no feasible solutions, i.e., if the constraints are mutually contradictory and cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Infeasibility may arise due to conflicting constraints or if the feasible region is empty.Degenerate Solu degenerate solution occurs when the optimal solution of an LP problem lies at the intersection of more than two constraints in the feasible region.Degeneracy can sometimes complicate the solution process and may require additional steps to resolve.Multiple Optimal Solutions:In some cases, an LP problem may have multiple optimal solutions, where more than one feasible solution achieves the same optimal objective function value.The existence of multiple optimal solutions can occur in degenerate LP problems or when the objective function is parallel to one or more constraints.</p>
    <h2><li>Simple method</li></h2>
    <p>The simplex method is a widely used algorithm for solving linear programming problems. It was developed by George Dantzig in 1947 and remains one of the most efficient methods for solving LP problems. The simplex method iteratively improves candidate solutions until an optimal solution is found. Here's a simplified explanation of the simplex method: Standard Form:Convert the LP problem into standard form if it is not already in that form. Ensure that all constraints are written as equalities, and all decision variables are non-negative.Initial Feasible Solution:Start with an initial feasible solution. This can be obtained by setting some of the decision variables to zero and solving the resulting system of equations to find values for the remaining variables.Optimality Test:Calculate the objective function value for the current solution.Check if the current solution is optimal. If the current solution satisfies all constraints and no further improvement can be made to the objective function value by changing the values of the decision variables, the solution is optimal. If not, proceed to the next step.Entering Variable:Select a non-basic variable (decision variable with a non-zero coefficient in the objective function) to enter the basis. Choose the entering variable with the most negative coefficient in the objective function (for minimization problems) or the most positive coefficient (for maximization problems).Leaving Variable:Determine which constraint becomes binding (i.e., active) when the entering variable is increased from zero.Choose the leaving variable by using the ratio test: divide the right-hand side of each constraint by the coefficient of the entering variable in that constraint.

    <h2><li>Procedure of the simplex method</li></h2>step-by-step procedure of the simplex method for solving linear programming problems:Initialization:Ensure that the LP problem is in standard form, with all constraints written as equalities and all decision variables non-negative.Identify the initial basic feasible solution by setting some variables to zero and solving the resulting system of equations for the remaining variables. Determine Initial Basic Feasible Solution:If the initial solution is not feasible (i.e., violates any constraint), use artificial variables to transform the problem into an auxiliary LP problem. The objective of the auxiliary problem is to minimize the sum of the artificial variables while still satisfying the original constraints. Apply the simplex method to the auxiliary problem to find an initial basic feasible solution.If the optimal value of the auxiliary problem is zero, the initial basic feasible solution is feasible for the original problem. Otherwise, the original problem is infeasible.Optimality Test:Calculate the objective function value for the current solution.Check if the current solution is optimal.

  <h1>NON-LINEAR PROGRAMMING</h1>
  <p>Nonlinear programming (NLP) is an extension of linear programming (LP) that deals with optimization problems where the objective function or constraints are nonlinear. Unlike in LP, where both the objective function and constraints are linear functions of the decision variables, NLP allows for more complex relationships between the variables.</p><ul>
    <h2><li>Introduction</li></h2>
    <p>Objective Function:In nonlinear programming, the objective function can be any nonlinear function of the decision variables. The objective may be to minimize or maximize the objective function, subject to certain constraints. Constraints:Constraints in nonlinear programming can also be nonlinear functions of the decision variables. Constraints can include equality constraints, inequality constraints, or both.Feasible Region:The feasible region in nonlinear programming is defined by the set of all feasible solutions that satisfy the nonlinear constraints.It may be bounded or unbounded, depending on the nature of the constraints. Optimization Methods:Solving nonlinear programming problems is generally more challenging than solving linear programming problems due to the complexity introduced by nonlinearities.Various optimization methods are used to solve NLP problems, including gradient-based methods, derivative-free optimization methods, heuristic algorithms, and metaheuristic algorithms. Gradient-based methods, such as gradient descent, Newton's method, and conjugate gradient methods, rely on derivatives of the objective function and constraints to iteratively improve candidate solutions.Derivative-free optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing, do not require derivatives and are suitable for problems with complex or discontinuous objective functions.</p>
    <h2><li>Quadratic programming variable technique</li></h2>
    <p>Interior Point Methods:Interior point methods are iterative optimization algorithms that exploit the structure of the quadratic programming problem to iteratively approach the optimal solution.These methods work by traversing the interior of the feasible region, converging to the optimal solution in a finite number of steps.Active Set Methods:Active set methods iteratively identify active constraints and solve quadratic subproblems to update the solution. These methods exploit the sparsity of the constraint matrix to efficiently determine the active set of constraints and update the solution accordingly.Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP):SQP methods solve a sequence of quadratic subproblems, each of which approximates the original nonlinear programming problem using local quadratic approximations.These methods iteratively update the solution by solving the quadratic subproblems and adjusting the optimization direction based on the local approximation of the objective function and constraints.Augmented Lagrangian Methods: Augmented Lagrangian methods combine the Lagrangian dual approach with penalty methods to handle nonlinear constraints in quadratic programming.These methods iteratively update the Lagrange multipliers and penalty parameters to enforce feasibility and optimality conditions.</p>
    <h2><li>Optimisation with equality constarains</li></h2>
    <p>Objective Function:In quadratic programming, the objective function is quadratic in nature, meaning it involves terms that are quadratic or linear in the decision variables.The objective function is typically written in the form:Minimize1�� Minimize 21 x TQx+c TxMaximize−1�Maximize− 1x TQx+c THere x represents the vector of decision variables Q is a symmetric positive semi-definite (for minimization) or negative semi-definite (for maximization) matrix representing the quadratic terms, and�c is a vector representing the linear terms.Constraints:Constraints in quadratic programming cane linear or nonlinear, but for simplicity, let's consider linear constraints.Linear constraints are written in the form�Ax≤�eqx=b eqHer is a matrix representinthe coefficients of the decision variables,� b is a vector of constants,  eqis a matrix representing the coefficients of the equality constraints, and��b eq is a vector of constants for the equality constraints. Solution Techniques Quadratic programming problems can be solved using various optimization algorithms, such as interior-point methods, active-set methods, and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods.These algorithms iteratively search for the optimal solution by updating the decision variables to minimize or maximize the objective function while satisfying the constraints.</p>
