    <u><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></u>
     
    <p>
      <h5> Imperative: Gives commands for the computer to execute step by  Functional: Treats functions as first-class citizens, emphasizes immutabi Object-Oriented: Organizes code around objects encapsulating data and beha Procedural: Focuses on procedures or routines breaking down tasks into smaller s Logical: Programs built on logical rules and facts, often using formal l Declarative: Focuses on what the program should accomplish rather than Event-Driven: Programs respond to events triggered by user interactions or system ev Aspect-Oriented: Modularizes cross-cutting concerns like logging and security from main l</h5></p>
  <ul>
    <h2><li>Names,Scope and Binding,Scope Rules</li></h2>
    <p>In programming, names are used to represent various entities like variables, functions, or classes. Scope refers to where these names are valid and accessible within the program, while binding associates a name with its entity. Scope rules define how names are resolved, such as static (determined by the program's structure) or dynamic (determined during runtime). Common scope rules include lexical (based on the program's text structure), dynamic (based on execution flow), block (limited to specific blocks), function (limited to functions), and global (accessible throughout the program). Understanding scope and binding is crucial for writing organized and error-free code.</p>
    <h2><li>Storage Management</li></h2>
    <p>Storage management in programming paradigms varies based on how memory allocation, usage, and deallocation are handled. In imperative and procedural programming, memory management is often explicit, with programmers responsible for allocating and freeing memory using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. Object-oriented programming blends automatic memory management for objects with manual management for non-object data. Functional and logical programming typically abstract memory management, relying on language runtimes or garbage collectors to automatically handle memory allocation and deallocation. Declarative programming also often abstracts memory management away from programmers, leaving it to the language runtime. Event-driven programming languages follow the memory management conventions of their underlying paradigms. Overall, different paradigms offer varying degrees of automatic versus manual memory management, impacting how programmers interact with memory in their code.</p>
      <h2><li>Type System , Checking Testing Assingment</li></h2>
    <p>Type system defines how data is classified and manipulated in programming languages, specifying rules for assigning types to variables, expressions, and functions, and how these types interact. Static typing checks types at compile-time, ensuring correctness before runtime, as seen in Java or C++. Dynamic typing, as in Python or JavaScript, checks types at runtime, offering flexibility but risking runtime errors. Strong typing enforces strict type conversions, preventing unexpected behavior, while weak typing allows implicit conversions. Type checking verifies correct type usage, either statically or dynamically, improving reliability. Testing evaluates program behavior against expected outcomes, with unit, integration, functional, and regression testing ensuring quality and bug detection. Assignment involves storing values in variables, a fundamental aspect of programming enabling data manipulation and storage.</p>
    <h2>Stack layout Calling and Passing Parameters</h2>
    <p>In programming, the stack plays a crucial role in managing function calls and local variables. Each function call creates a new stack frame, containing parameters, return addresses, and local variables. The stack grows and shrinks dynamically as functions are called and return.Calling conventions define the rules for how functions are called and parameters are passed between caller and callee. For example, in the stdcall convention, the callee cleans up the stack after the call, while in cdecl, it's the caller's responsibility. Other conventions like fastcall and thiscall optimize parameter passing for specific scenarios.Parameters can be passed to functions in various ways, including registers, the stack, and by value or reference. Register passing is faster but limited, while passing by reference allows modifications to the original data. These mechanisms are crucial for efficient function invocation and memory management in programs.</p>
    <h2><li>Generic Subroutines and Modules</li></h2>
    <p>Generic subroutines are versatile functions capable of working with multiple data types or algorithms. By parameterizing their implementation, they adapt to diverse input types, enhancing code reusability and adaptability. In languages like C++, templates enable the creation of generic functions or classes, where types are specified as parameters. This approach minimizes code duplication and promotes modular, flexible designs.Modules, on the other hand, are units of code organization that encapsulate related procedures, functions, and data structures. They promote modularity and separation of concerns by grouping related functionality together. Modules offer clear interfaces, hiding implementation details while allowing interaction with their functionality. This aids in improving code organization, readability, and maintainability, especially in complex systems.Together, generic subroutines and modules contribute to efficient, modular codebases that facilitate code reuse, scalability, and maintainability in software development.</p>
    <h2><li>Exception Handling</li></h2>
    <p>Exception handling is a programming mechanism that deals with unexpected or exceptional situations that may occur during program execution. When an error occurs, an exception is raised, triggering the execution of specialized code known as an exception handler. In most languages, exception handling is done using try-catch blocks. The code that might raise an exception is placed within the try block, while the corresponding exception handling code is enclosed within a catch block. Exception handling allows for the graceful recovery from errors, ensuring that the program continues to execute without crashing. Additionally, it facilitates the cleanup of resources, even in the event of an exception, through the use of finally blocks. By effectively managing exceptions, developers can create more robust and reliable software, enhancing the overall stability and resilience of their applications.</p>
    <h2><li>Co routines and Event</li></h2>
    <p>Coroutines and events are essential programming concepts that play distinct roles in software development. Coroutines enable cooperative multitasking within a single thread, allowing functions to yield control temporarily and resume execution later. They are particularly useful for handling asynchronous I/O operations and implementing non-blocking code. On the other hand, events are notifications or signals that indicate when specific actions or conditions occur in a program. In event-driven programming paradigms, such as graphical user interfaces or web applications, events trigger the execution of event handlers or callbacks. This allows programs to respond dynamically to user input, network activity, or system events. Both coroutines and events are fundamental in building responsive, efficient, and interactive software systems, albeit serving different purposes in handling program flow and asynchronous operations.</p>

  <u><h1>IMPERATIVE PARADIGM</h1></u>
  <p>Imperative programming is a fundamental programming paradigm where programs are structured as sequences of statements that explicitly detail how to accomplish tasks. In this paradigm, developers focus on changing program states using variables and control flow structures such as loops and conditionals. Procedures and functions organize code into reusable blocks, facilitating modular programming. A key characteristic of imperative programming is mutability, allowing for direct modification of data. Programs are executed sequentially, with each statement executed in order, enabling step-by-step execution. While imperative programming offers a clear and straightforward approach to algorithm implementation, it can lead to issues like side effects. Despite this, imperative programming remains widely used, forming the basis for many other programming paradigms and languages.</p>
    <ul>
    <h2><li>Encapsulation</li></h2>
    <p>Encapsulation, a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), involves bundling data and methods together within a class. This bundling forms a protective barrier around the data, shielding it from direct external access. Instead, interactions with the data occur through well-defined interfaces provided by the class.By hiding internal implementation details, encapsulation fosters data integrity and protects the integrity of the object's state. This means that changes made to the internal workings of the class do not impact the external code that uses it.Encapsulation offers several advantages. It promotes abstraction, allowing developers to focus on an object's behavior rather than its implementation. It enhances modularity by encapsulating related data and functionality within a single unit, facilitating code reuse and maintenance. Additionally, encapsulation improves security by restricting access to sensitive data and providing controlled means of interaction.In essence, encapsulation is a cornerstone of OOP that promotes robust, maintainable, and secure software development practices by encapsulating data and functionality, and controlling access to them through well-defined interfaces.</p>
    <h2><li>Overloading</li></h2>
    <p>Function overloading is a programming feature that enables multiple functions within the same scope to share the same name but have different parameter lists. This means that functions with the same name can perform distinct tasks based on the number or types of parameters they receive. When a function is called, the compiler determines which version of the function to execute based on the arguments provided. This allows developers to create functions that are more intuitive and easier to understand, as related functionalities can be grouped under the same name. Additionally, function overloading promotes code reusability by enabling developers to reuse function names across different contexts without needing unique names for each variation. While function overloading enhances flexibility and convenience in programming, it's important to use it judiciously to maintain code clarity and avoid confusion.</p>
      <h2><li>Polymorphism</li></h2>
    <p>Polymorphism is a cornerstone of object-oriented programming, facilitating code flexibility and reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface. This concept manifests in two forms: compile-time polymorphism, where the appropriate function is determined by the compiler based on parameters passed, and run-time polymorphism, where the function to execute is decided dynamically based on the actual type of the object being referenced.
        Compile-time polymorphism, achieved through method overloading, enables multiple functions with the same name but different parameters to coexist within a class. This versatility allows developers to handle various argument types or quantities efficiently.In contrast, run-time polymorphism, achieved through method overriding, empowers subclasses to provide specialized implementations of methods defined in their superclass. By dynamically determining the method to execute based on the object's actual type, run-time polymorphism enhances code extensibility and adaptability.Polymorphism promotes modular and flexible software design, simplifies code maintenance, and fosters code reuse. It embodies the principles of abstraction and encapsulation, enabling developers to write cleaner, more scalable, and maintainable code. Overall, polymorphism is a powerful mechanism that empowers developers to build robust and adaptable software systems in the object-oriented paradigm.</p>
      <h2><li>Inheritance</li></h2>
    <p>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows new classes to be created based on existing classes, thereby inheriting their attributes and behaviors. Inheritance facilitates code reuse, promotes modularity, and enables the creation of more specialized classes that extend the functionality of their parent classes.Inheritance is typically implemented through a superclass-subclass relationship, where the subclass (also known as the derived class) inherits properties and methods from its superclass (also known as the base class or parent class). This means that the subclass automatically has access to all the public and protected members of its superclass, including variables, methods, and constructors.Through inheritance, subclasses can add new features or modify existing ones without altering the original superclass, promoting the principle of code extensibility. This allows developers to create hierarchies of related classes, with each level of inheritance providing additional specialization and customization.nheritance also fosters code organization and maintenance by promoting a hierarchical structure in which classes with similar characteristics are grouped together. This makes it easier to manage and update code, as changes made to the superclass automatically propagate to all subclasses. Overall, inheritance is a powerful mechanism in OOP that enhances code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates the creation of flexible and scalable software systems. By leveraging inheritance, developers can build more efficient and maintainable codebases that adapt to changing requirements and promote code extensibility.</p>
    <h2><li>Initialization and Finalization</li></h2>
    <p>Initialization and finalization are key aspects of managing resources and ensuring proper program execution in software development.

        1. **Initialization**:
           Initialization refers to the process of preparing resources, such as variables, objects, or data structures, for use within a program. This includes allocating memory, setting default values, and performing any necessary setup tasks.
        
           In object-oriented programming, initialization often involves creating objects and invoking constructors to initialize their state. Constructors are special methods within classes that are called automatically when an object is created.Initialization tasks may also include establishing connections to external resources, such as databases or network services, and initializing configuration settings
        2. **Finalization**: Finalization, also known as cleanup or teardown, is the process of releasing resources and performing cleanup tasks when they are no longer needed or when the program is about to terminate Finalization is crucial for managing resources efficiently and preventing resource leaks, memory leaks, or other resource-related issues. It involves releasing memory, closing connections, and performing any necessary cleanup operations to ensure that resources are properly deallocated.In object-oriented programming, finalization often involves invoking destructors or finalizer methods to release resources associated with objects. Destructors are special methods within classes that are called automatically when an object is destroyed or goes out of scope.Finalization tasks may also include saving data, closing files, releasing locks, and freeing up any other resources that were allocated during initialization.Overall, initialization and finalization are essential steps in the lifecycle of a program, ensuring that resources are properly managed and that the program executes correctly. Proper initialization sets the stage for program execution by preparing resources for use, while finalization ensures that resources are released and cleanup tasks are performed to maintain program integrity and efficiency.</p>
    <h2><li>Dynamic Binding</li></h2>
    <p>Dynamic binding, also known as late binding or runtime binding, is a crucial mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows for polymorphic behavior. Unlike static binding, where the method to be called is determined at compile-time based on the reference type, dynamic binding defers this decision until runtime based on the actual type of the object.This means that when a method is invoked on an object, the specific implementation of that method is determined dynamically, based on the actual class of the object at runtime. Dynamic binding enables subclasses to override methods defined in their superclass, allowing for more flexible and polymorphic behavior.Dynamic binding plays a significant role in enabling polymorphism, a key feature of object-oriented programming. It allows different objects of related classes to respond differently to the same method call, depending on their runtime type. This promotes code reuse, modularity, and extensibility, as it allows for more flexible and adaptable software designs.Languages like Java, C++, and Python leverage dynamic binding to enable polymorphism and facilitate object-oriented programming paradigms effectively. By deferring method resolution until runtime, dynamic binding enables developers to write more expressive and modular code that can adapt to changing requirements and contexts.</p>

 <u><h1>DECLARATIVE PROGRAMMING</h1></u>

<ul><li><h2> Lambda Calculus:</h2></li></ul>
 Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It was introduced by mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as a way to formalize computability and the notion of functions.
 <br>
 In lambda calculus:
 <ul>
 <li>Variables: Denote placeholders for values.</li>
<li> Abstraction (λ-abstraction): Defines anonymous functions by specifying their arguments and body. For example, \( λx.x+1 \) represents a function that takes \( x \) and returns \( x + 1 \).</li>
<li>  Application: Applying a function to an argument, e.g., \( (λx.x+1) \, 2 \) would evaluate to \( 2 + 1 \).</li>
 </ul>
 <ul><li><h2>Functional Programming Concepts:</h2></li></ul>
 Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. Key concepts include:
 <ul>
 <li>First-class functions: Functions can be treated as first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.</li>
<li> Immutability: Data, once created, cannot be changed. Instead, new data is created.</li>
<li> Referential transparency: The same function, given the same inputs, always returns the same outputs.</li>
<li> Pattern matching: A way of matching values against patterns and deconstructing data structures.</li>
<li> Recursion: Functions can call themselves to solve problems, instead of using iterative loops.</li>
</ul>   
 <ul><li><h2>Evaluation Order:</h2></li></ul>
 In functional programming, evaluation order determines how expressions are reduced to values. Common evaluation orders include:
 <ul>
<li> Applicative order (eager evaluation): Arguments are evaluated before the function is applied.</li>
 <li>Normal order (lazy evaluation): Arguments are not evaluated until they are actually needed by the function.</li>
 </ul>
 <ul><li><h2>Higher-order Functions:</h2></li></ul>
 Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. They enable powerful abstraction and are central to functional programming style. Examples include map, filter, and reduce.
 
 <ul><li><h2> I/O-Streams:</h2></li></ul>
 In functional programming, handling input/output (I/O) is typically done using monads or monad-like constructs. Streams abstract over sequences of data, allowing for lazy evaluation and composition. Monads provide a way to encapsulate I/O operations in a pure functional context.
 
 <ul><li><h2> Monads:</h2></li></ul>
 Monads are a design pattern used to structure computations in a functional way while allowing side effects. They provide a way to sequence actions, manage state, handle errors, and perform I/O in a pure functional language. Monads have three main components:
 <ul>
<li> Unit (or return): Lifts a value into the monadic context.</li>
<li> Bind (>>=): Chains computations together.</li>
<li> Join: Flattens nested monadic structures.</li>
 </ul>
 For example, in Haskell, the `IO` monad is used to encapsulate I/O actions, ensuring purity and allowing for sequencing of I/O operations.

  <u><h1>LOGIC PROGRAMMING</h1></u>

  
  <ul><li><h2>Resolution and Unification:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Resolution: The process of finding a substitution for variables in logical statements (clauses) to prove a query. Prolog uses a backward-chaining inference mechanism called resolution to search for a solution.</li>
<li>  Unification: The process of finding a common instance of two logical terms. In Prolog, unification is the primary mechanism for matching patterns and binding variables.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul><li><h2>Lists:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul>
<li>  Prolog provides built-in support for lists, which are fundamental data structures.</li>
<li>  Lists are represented by square brackets and can contain elements of any data type, including other lists.</li>
<li>  Operations like appending, splitting, and accessing elements can be performed using built-in predicates like `append/3`, `member/2`, and `nth0/3`.</li>
</ul>  
  <ul><li><h2>Arithmetic Execution Order:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul> 
<li>  In Prolog, arithmetic expressions are evaluated using built-in predicates like `is/2` or `=/2`.</li>
<li>  Prolog evaluates arithmetic expressions in a top-down, left-to-right order, just like in conventional programming languages.</li>
<li>  Parentheses can be used to enforce a specific order of evaluation.</li>
</ul>
  
  <ul><li><h2> Imperative Control Flow:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul> 
  <li>Prolog primarily follows a declarative programming paradigm, where the order of predicates in clauses is not significant.</li>
<li>  However, control flow can be achieved using built-in control structures like `if-then-else`, `cut (!)`, and recursion.</li>
<li>  The cut `(!)` is used to commit to a choice, preventing backtracking beyond its position in the program.</li></ul>
  
  <ul><li><h2>Database Manipulation:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul>
<li>  Prolog databases consist of facts and rules, which are used to define relationships and properties.</li>
<li>  Facts are assertions about the domain, while rules define logical implications.</li>
<li>   Dynamic predicates can be modified at runtime using built-in predicates like `assert/1`, `retract/1`, and `consult/1`.</li></ul>
  
  <ul><li><h2>Prolog Facilities and Deficiencies:</h2></li></ul>
  <ul><li>Facilities: Prolog provides a powerful mechanism for expressing and solving logical queries, making it suitable for symbolic computation, natural language processing, and expert systems.</li>
  <li>Deficiencies: Prolog's performance can degrade when handling large datasets or complex search spaces due to its naive search strategy. Additionally, the lack of built-in support for data structures like arrays and hash tables can limit its applicability in certain domains.</li></ul>
  
  <ul><li><h4>Example:</h4></li></ul>
  prolog
  <br>% Define a predicate to find the factorial of a number
  <br>factorial(0, 1).    % Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
  <br>factorial(N, F) :-
  <br>N > 0,
  <br>N1 is N - 1,
  <br>factorial(N1, F1),
  <br>F is N * F1.
  
  <br>% Query: What is the factorial of 5?
  <br>% ?- factorial(5, Result).
  <br>% Output: Result = 120.
  <br>
  
  In this example, `factorial/2` is a recursive predicate that computes the factorial of a number. It demonstrates Prolog's ability to express mathematical operations and recursive algorithms concisely.

  <u><h1>CONCURRENCY</h1></u>
  
  Concurrent programming deals with the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously, either on multiple cores of a CPU or across different computational units. Here's a detailed explanation of concurrent programming fundamentals, including synchronization, message passing, multithreading, communication, synchronization mechanisms, and thread creation syntax:

  <ul><li><h2>Concurrent Programming Fundamentals:</h2></li></ul>
  - Concurrency: The ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time.
  <br>- Parallelism: Execution of multiple tasks simultaneously, typically on multiple CPU cores.
  <br>- Concurrency vs. Parallelism: Concurrency refers to structuring programs for simultaneous execution, while parallelism involves executing those concurrent tasks simultaneously.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Implementing Synchronization:</h2></li></ul>
  - Synchronization: Coordinating the execution of concurrent threads to ensure correct behavior and avoid race conditions.
  <br>- Common synchronization mechanisms include locks (mutexes), semaphores, and condition variables.
  <br>- Synchronization prevents data races and ensures that shared resources are accessed safely by multiple threads.
  
  <ul><li><h2> Message Passing - Background and Motivation:</h2></li></ul>
  - Message Passing: Communication mechanism where processes or threads exchange data by sending and receiving messages.
  <br>- Motivation: Message passing facilitates communication between concurrent entities without the need for shared memory, reducing complexity and potential for errors in synchronization.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Multithreaded Programs:</h2></li></ul>
  - Multithreading: Executing multiple threads within a single process to achieve concurrency.
  <br>- Multithreading enables programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving responsiveness and resource utilization.
  <br> - Threads within the same process share memory space, allowing for efficient communication and synchronization.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Communication and Synchronization:</h2></li></ul>
  - Communication: Threads communicate by sharing data or passing messages.
  <br>- Synchronization: Ensuring orderly access to shared resources to prevent race conditions and maintain consistency.
  <br>- Techniques like locks, condition variables, and atomic operations are used for synchronization.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Language and Libraries:</h2></li></ul>
  - Programming Languages: Many programming languages provide built-in support for concurrency and multithreading, including Java, C++, Python, and Go.
  <br>- Concurrency Libraries: Frameworks and libraries like Java's `java.util.concurrent`, Python's `multiprocessing`, and C++'s `std::thread` provide abstractions and tools for concurrent programming.
  
  <ul><li><h2> Thread Creation Syntax:</h2></li></ul>
  - Syntax varies by programming language:
  <br>- In Java: Threads are typically created by extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.
  <br>- In C++: Threads are created using the `std::thread` class and function pointers.
  <br>- In Python: Threads are created using the `threading` module or the `concurrent.futures` module for higher-level abstractions.
  
  <ul><li><h4>Example (Java):</h4></li></ul>
  ```java
  <br>  public class MyThread extends Thread {
    <br>public void run() {
      <br>  // Thread logic here
      <br>}
  
      <br> public static void main(String[] args) {
        <br>MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        <br>thread.start(); // Start the thread
        <br>}
        <br>}
  ```
  <br>
  In this example, a Java thread is created by extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run()` method. The `start()` method initiates the execution of the thread.

  <u><h1>SCRIPTING LANGUAGE</h1></u>
  
  Scripting languages share common characteristics and are often used across various problem domains, including web development. 

  <ul><li><h2>Common Characteristics of Scripting Languages:</h2></li></ul>
  <b>1. Interpreted:</b> Scripting languages are typically interpreted rather than compiled, meaning that source code is executed directly without prior compilation.
  <br><b>2. Dynamic Typing:</b> They usually employ dynamic typing, allowing variables to change types at runtime without explicit type declarations.
  <br><b>3. Automatic Memory Management:</b> Scripting languages often feature garbage collection, relieving developers from manual memory management tasks.
  <br><b>4. High-level Abstractions:</b> They provide high-level constructs and abstractions, enabling developers to write code more concisely and expressively.
  <br><b>5. Ease of Learning and Use:</b> Scripting languages prioritize simplicity and ease of use, making them accessible to a wide range of developers.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Different Problem Domains for Using Scripting:</h2></li></ul>
  <b>1. Automation:</b> Scripting languages are commonly used for automating repetitive tasks, such as system administration tasks (e.g., shell scripting).
  <br><b>2. Text Processing:</b> They excel at text manipulation, parsing, and processing large volumes of textual data.
  <br><b>3. Web Development:</b> Scripting languages are extensively used for both server-side and client-side web development.
  <br><b>4. Data Analysis and Visualization:</b> Scripting languages like Python are popular for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tasks.
  <br><b>5. Prototyping and Rapid Development:</b> Due to their ease of use and dynamic nature, scripting languages are often used for prototyping and rapid development of software applications.
  
  <ul><li><h2>Use of Scripting in Web Development:</h2></li></ul>
  <b>1. Server-Side Scripting:</b> Scripting languages like PHP, Python (with frameworks like Django or Flask), and Node.js (using JavaScript) are used for server-side scripting to generate dynamic web content, handle HTTP requests, and interact with databases.
  <br><b>2. Client-Side Scripting:</b> JavaScript is the predominant scripting language for client-side web development. It enhances interactivity and responsiveness by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling user events within web browsers.
  
  <ul><li><h2> Innovative Features of Scripting Languages:</h2></li></ul>
  <b>1. Names and Scopes:</b> Scripting languages often support dynamic scoping and closures, allowing variables to be accessed within nested functions or blocks.
  <br><b>2. String and Pattern Manipulation:</b> They provide powerful string manipulation features, including regular expressions for pattern matching and manipulation.
  <br><b>3. Data Types:</b> Scripting languages support various data types such as strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries (associative arrays), and often provide built-in support for complex data structures.
  <br><b>4. Object Orientation:</b> Many scripting languages support object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
  
  <ul><li><h4>Example (Python):</h4></li></ul>
  <b>```python
  <br># Example demonstrating string manipulation and object orientation in Python
  
  <br># Define a class
  <br>class Person:
  <br>def __init__(self, name, age):
  <br>    self.name = name
  <br>    self.age = age
  <br>
      def greet(self):
      <br>    print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
      <br>
  # Create an instance of the class
  <br> person = Person("Alice", 30)
  
  <br># Access object properties
  <br>print(person.name)  # Output: Alice
  
  <br># Call object method
  <br>person.greet()  <br># Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.
  ```
  <br>
  In this example, Python is used to define a `Person` class with properties (`name`, `age`) and a method (`greet`). Objects of this class can be created and manipulated, demonstrating the object-oriented features of Python. Additionally, Python's string manipulation capabilities are showcased.
